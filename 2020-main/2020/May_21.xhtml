    <p>         Halo, I didn’t get to read the psycho-epistemological discourse on art yesterday, there was no electricity, I will today though.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         I learned today the cause of trends, it’s philosophy . . . from the Romantic Manifesto of art by Ayn Rand.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         An excerpt from a reading of the Romantic Manifesto by Ayn Rand: <i> The course of mankind’s </i> <strong><i> progress</i> </strong><i>  is not a straight, automatic line, but a tortuous struggle, with long detours or relapses into the stagnant night of the irrational. Mankind moves forward by the grace of those </i> <strong><i> human bridges</i> </strong><i>  who are able to </i> <strong><i> grasp and transmit</i> </strong><i> , across years or centuries, the achievements men had reached—and to carry them further. </i> A representation of what I hope my life represents, leaving my job to understand my roots, better building on my persona, understanding what ticks, and curbing ticks that deter motion in progress.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         I think it’s safe to say; draw the consensus, that the phenomenon discussed earlier in this journal is finally understood, the constant insurgency and disturbance well known, is a direct result of the detour of the human into a subterranean sensory level of awareness, a state that is sub-perceptual—the decline into the sub-animal, the acculturation to the barbaric.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         A fact to keep with me as I progress, is the fact that art, like literature is not a social endeavour, a reminder to revoke the impose in surfeit of the <i> darkseid</i> .</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         The constant suggestions and tries at “elucidating”<i>  </i> or analysing art—music, movies, etc.<i> —</i> is a contrived attempt at impeding the growth of the individual, the insularly altruistic nature of the avatar by agents with sub-animal agendas. This voids the individual of the much needed expression of the mind through art. A crime of the spirit.</p>

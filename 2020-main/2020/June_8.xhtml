    <p>         I started today with a clean approach at the discrepancies - absorption. LIVING IN THE MOMENT, from time to time adds up to the beauty of success. I’ll quote an excerpt from a book I am currently reading - The weekend by Charlotte Wood: <i> It was true that time had gradually taken on a different cast. It didn’t seem to go forwards or backwards now, but up and down. The past was striated through you, through your body, leaching into the present and the future. The striations were evident, these streaky layers of memory, of experience—but you were one being, you contained all of it. If you looked behind or ahead of you, all was emptiness</i> . A quiet hinting at the evidence of the beauty in dwelling in the moment, for the past sits in the farthest recess of our cognitive discerning, forever informing our percepts.</p>

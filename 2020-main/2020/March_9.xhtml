    <p>         Today is a day of similar distaste, my dad is yet to reply me, at this point, he doesn’t feel much like dad, it feels more like a friend you avoid so you don’t get dragged down along. I am done with the sequel to <i> wild seed.</i> </p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         Just after my last input, my dad walked in, I think it’s time to switch the narrative from “I had my dad walk in” to “my dad walked in” (this being the instinctual impulse at reasoning), abstaining from the revolt of the gulf; this being the collective I have come to recognize as a body of individuals with shared motives and ideals, with the aim of constant cognitive dissolution, especially of the precepts of objective reality operations, destroying language, perception, and introducing in its place, a life of disharmony and a halt of progression.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         The question is what is the motif and what are the ideals shared? This should be my assignment. Figuring it out, outside of the arbitrary aims at confusion.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         So I came up with a word to replace the phrase “<i> can you imagine</i> ” the word is <i> Cincinnati</i> .</p>

    <p>         Woke up this morning feeling great, meditated, got to listening in on some cool tracks and now I’m about to bathe. It’s good to be alive, I hope I get to do a lot today.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         After writing my dad a letter, hoping in disguise I’m writing a letter to myself; in hopes that I get an empathic reply, I figured on re-reading, I discover I have an acquiesce to look forward to: a response from my dad stating if his volition has been of good intent.</p>

    <p>Below is a true copy of the letter.</p>
<p> </p>
    <p>         <i> Whatever game you’re playing whether through direct contact or through means elusive, kindly note my understanding is diminishing and my resort is to keep all I brace important away from you.</i> </p>

    <p>         <i> If you find this offensive, please know I’m offended and the only recourse is to leave me to my own devices.</i> </p>

    <p>         <i> I’m no child, neither am I clinically sick, if my judgements are wrong based on “facts” you raised me by; building on from, are lies, then know I ‘ll remain disappointed even after you read this.</i> </p>

    <p>         <i> I can no longer fold my arms while you pretend not to be aware of who I am.</i> </p>

    <p>         <i> This will be the only form of accusal at a narrative I’ve come to perceive in your ways.</i> </p>

    <p>         <i> You know my mistakes, all of them. I may not know yours but I can feel their scornful effects.</i> </p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         In Émile, or on education by Jean-Jacques Rousseau he talks about the way in which a human being left to his devices will naturally be good, hence the notion <i> the noble savage</i> .</p>

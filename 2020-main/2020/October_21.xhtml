    <p>         So CYN, posts a video talking about her new song <i> New York</i>  and in it, she says her song is to be out PST, on my lookup I discover it is PDT.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p><i> Specifically, time in this zone is referred to as "Pacific Standard Time" (PST) when standard time is being observed (early November to mid-March), and "Pacific Daylight Time" (PDT) when daylight saving time (mid-March to early November) is being observed.</i> </p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         The cat down the road is <i> Ralph Smart</i> , who would have known, that was <i> Ralph</i>  down before the passage way at the apartment in Sharjah. Also <i> Can I get a hello there </i> also is an allusion to the supposition of someone connecting, like “hello there, I also haven’t had breakfast”.</p>

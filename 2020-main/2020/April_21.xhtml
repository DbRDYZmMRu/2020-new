    <p>         I woke up today, not much of a mood, woke up indifferent, after doing my mantra, I went out for my drapery, washed the day before, to my surprise, I found some of my clothes soaked and on the floor in a liquid that smells awful, this isn’t the first time, it’s sad because I see no reason why anyone should want to hurt me. As stated yesterday I’ll remain compassionate, staying sane.</p>

    <p>         The Logos is an ethical proposition; the action of being, characterized in Christianity as the operation of truth encouraged, nested in love on potential, enacting the proposition out of courage; telling the truth. Represented in Genesis as the world springing to being, as a consequence of the action of the logos. If the logos is operative on the idea of potential, what then emerges is good by definition in the absence of proof which is arrived at the enacting of the proposition, bringing to the bear the essence of God himself.</p>

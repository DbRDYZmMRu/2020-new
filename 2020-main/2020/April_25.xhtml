    <p>         Repetitiveness doesn’t breed progress, a personal observation through a self-willed state.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         Understanding <i> civil</i>  implies environmental in certain context is cool.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         I love it when I think of the utter unimportance of living a life that isn’t worth living, and a muscle spasm reiterates in consensus. It’s the only reason I need for my second suicide attempt. I should a fix a date, probably before the Coronavirus, give myself a last: <i> what is on my mind</i> .</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         I choose not to bother or displease my existence by pondering any of the ephemeral thoughts suggested, carrying out the current task is all that is of importance.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         Concentrate on the effect of your actions on your well-being, not others.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         The day the story of the lonesome Robinson Crusoe is published by Daniel Defoe in 1719.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         Thinking to myself, the constant perturbation of my state of consciousness, the almost perishing of the concept of <i> me</i> . To think that I come from a lineage of royalty, a supposed dignified, regal race, I doubt it.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         Reading the book <i> Breaking open the head</i>  I come by this idea by R. Gordon Wasson : “<i> A prodigious expansion in Man’s memory must have been the gift that differentiated mankind from his predecessors, and I surmise that this expansion in memory led to a simultaneous growth in the gift of language, these two powers generating in man that self-consciousness which is the third of the triune traits that alone make man unique. . . . I am asking myself whether Soma could have possessed the power to spark what I have called these triune traits.</i> ” it’s a surmise not a factual theory. Wasson later came to deplore the idea of psychedelia saying “<i> Although these fungi had produced all of the great philosophic visions of antiquity, he proclaimed they had no relevance to the modern world.</i> ”</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         I wish my problems were pellucid. I catch myself doing things the wrong way. I want to cry most times, but in the end to live is to know when to die I think.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         To think I came home as an act of convalesce, only to deteriorate to a state of almost madness is beyond sad I . . .</p>

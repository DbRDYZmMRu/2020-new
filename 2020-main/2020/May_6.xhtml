    <p>         This morning was upsetting as much as it was a terrible experience, I was divided between getting something reasonable off the internet and catching a well-deserved sleep. The ever, never-alluring, attention seeking, sap-sipping invertebrate of a collective screaming out my window, informing on how impossible it is for sanity to reign, is just an attempt at a kick-off that will never see the fringes of hostility. The defending camp’s precinct’s bulwark heeds tyranny.</p>

    <p>         I’m in no mood for any leftovers today, my bloodstream screams in imprints of wakefulness. To be without prejudice, to act with justice, to keep an even keel, to be in control of yourself—even when that means dedication and sacrifice is the mantra for the year. 2020 is a year of character building and vision visualization.</p>

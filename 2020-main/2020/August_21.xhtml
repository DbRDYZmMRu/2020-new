    <p>         Today has been a long day, the week longer. So much has happened that I’m not even aware of, from making a lot of noise on twitter, to falling in and out of character, to not understanding my feelings; how I really feel about Jessica. Now I’m here reminiscing, thinking of all the days I have missed in my journal. Well it’s not like I spent all these days not doing anything, it’s just that most of the time I was caught up either reading or thinking about Jessica, one thing is for sure, as the day devotion says, I will not sit waiting for misery or joy, instead I will continue with my job-work. Getting shit done.</p>

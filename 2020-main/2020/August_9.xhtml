    <p>         One of the posts I lost yesterday included one on my Girl, Jessica Andrea. Damn, it’s crazy how identity can get warped in tangles of uncertainty and frivolous constants bearing nonsense; the idea of the <i> Parastitch </i> — the name I’ve come up with for the consensus of the game-mind, the occluded-minded community I currently reside in.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         Yesterday was International Cat Day, the previous night I saw a cat in my compound, hahaha. It was in the flower bed. It soon left like a visitor, no sense that one was fraidy. I might get a cat you know.</p>

    <p>         I’ve learned three things now today, the first one is <i> politics is a substratum from culture</i> . Second is <i> USSR means United Soviet Socialist Republic</i>  and the . . . Third is <i> Capitalism is hard to teach; understanding the hidden hand of the market, incentives, if you haven’t been taught what an earnest day’s work means and how valuable it is to the human heart</i> .</p>

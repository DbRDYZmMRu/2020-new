    <p>         “Remember to laugh cos you live in a crazy world where you never guess what could happen next “and I quote, <i> Owl city</i>  from <i> Alligator Sky</i> , this is in relation to my dad’s discussion with me this morning. Earlier he had informed me; some days ago, on how the current relationship between the US and Nigeria has deteriorated to a diplomatic knot, and visiting visa issuing has been halted indefinitely. Hence, he suggested we come up with a plan B, one where I don’t leave the country, hence I informed him on how it’s no way of living to have your plans constantly changed, hence we flicked the decision coin decisively, this time going for head over tail in the course of action and choosing to call the agent who is to handle the travelling before going ahead to formulate the proposed alternative plan. On calling the agent, he informs us on how, he’s heard the news and the only reason the visa will be refused is if the request is for immigration, which mine isn’t. That has been taken care of. I’m writing this having another month of wait before my passport gets to him and any process is begun, I honestly feel terrible, depleted, misinformed, away from the path, slow and delineated to a par or caste I’d rather not belong to. It’s fine though, I’m expecting a project from a group of friends, if it comes in, good; I’d be really excited, if it doesn’t . . . I’ll be awful blatant, it’s been a rise of state and to fall off before the climax, the peak state of being will be undesirable.</p>

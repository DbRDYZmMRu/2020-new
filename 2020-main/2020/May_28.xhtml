    <p>         Regardless of what happens, how I feel, I still exist. I woke up feeling disturbed as I have for days, I will be fine.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         In such epoch where the highest values of life—our peace, our independence, our basic rights, all that makes our existence more pure, more beautiful, all that justifies it—are sacrificed to the demon inhabiting a dozen fanatics and ideologues. All the problems of the man who fears for his humanity come down to the same question: <i> how to remain free?</i>  <strong>Stefan Zweig</strong></p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         Me in chains? You may fetter my leg but my will, not even Zeus himself can overpower. <strong>Epictetus</strong></p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         In the task of self-creation, the size of the task itself must not be used as an excuse to shy away from the task, I shouldn’t complain of all that is happening to me, I asked for it, no one said it’d be easy.</p>

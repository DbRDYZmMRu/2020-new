    <p>         Woke up today with acute pains to my right loins, just below my ribs — my fault. I ingested broken crumbs, a pill of aceclofenac and paracetamol a day before, had it consecutively for days, even snorted some out of consternation — a degrading leading to paralysis of the willed impulse I’m yet to have in check. Periodically I’ve waved my incessant reflex, the passive pallid state of intolerance, my inability to deal with the constant negation of my mental health. Reflecting on the issues individually is a daunting but as stated by NF REAL in this line “<i> Pursuin' the mental can be dark and be difficult but the pay off at the end of it can help you to get through it</i> ” this line breathes a whoosh of divinity on me right now. I’ll map every fear, every error, every articulated and acted out aim at impeding my build out of hell.</p>

    <p>         Today marks to bear in history the birthday of sir Wilbert William Shakespeare.</p>

    <p>Today in history immortalizes the battle of the French and Austrians in the Napoleon war, the battle of Ratisbon</p>

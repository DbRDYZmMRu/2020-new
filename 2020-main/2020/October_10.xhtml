    <p>         Today is a beautiful day to journal, I’ve been away from journaling a while now, my dreams don’t even go here, most of the writing I have been doing comprise only of mails and tweets to Jessica. Helping my writing, I promise to string at least some thoughts from my day. The problem really is, there is hardly ever anything to journal, the real problem or thing holding me back is, I find it hard to create the initial entries in the morning. Aiding myself, I’ll create the entry for the day just after finishing with the reoccurring headings for the day before.</p>

    <p>         Today is <i> World Homeless Day</i>  a reminder, and international awareness emblem for homelessness and extreme poverty. </p>

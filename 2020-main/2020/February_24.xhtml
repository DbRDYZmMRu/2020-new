    <p>         Haven’t filled my journal in a while, it’s been all activity; streams of um, I think I’ve missed it, I have been reading series of books, currently reading three novels, <i> The Lucky one by Lori-Day</i> , <i> Wild Seed by E. Butler</i>  and <i> City of girls by Elizabeth Gilbert</i> . Great books, I think I prefer reading a bunch at a time, stirs the mind better, almost like seeing bunch of sitcoms. </p>

    <p>I’ve been thinking about my travel, the commissioner of police my dad told me about, got his appointment, happy about that, also I’m yet to receive the call of invitation for the visit to the native priest, well I hope it never comes, it’s a good morning, the electricity’s been out since yesterday night, it was not a good night, I had damn mosquitos, begging me to quit from my sleep; sucks like spittle on your mane.</p>

    <p>I’ll listen in now on the poem of the day, the poem from days ago; the little mute boy, now that’s something.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         Yesterday a memorable day in history; the day the first bible was printed, <i> the Gutenberg bible</i> .</p>

    <p>Inputting notes on my research on Ayn Rand, I discovered, the word <i> Objectivism</i>  isn’t in the windows dictionary, at least the dictionary I currently use and in place of it as a substitute is the word <i> Collectivism</i> , that’s awkward. </p>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>EDIT</strong>(27/04/2020):</p>

    <p>I will be updating the dictionary.</p>

    <p>         On the 12<sup>th</sup> of April 1961 , the Russian Cosmonaut Yuri Alekseyevich Gagarin became the first human to travel to space. He is also the first person to orbit earth.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         Who’s forced me to grow up, taking my memes from me, the beauty of solitude on my electronic devices. I’ll definitely get them back.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         I should be careful what I share with people and what I heed to, as a lot of people know not the second of what they speak of, as in the case of the neighbour who dismissed my attempts at reading the Nietzsche literature by dismissing them as books of moral depravity. Only in a book by Jim Proser; the Savage Messiah to discover the depth of the acknowledgement of the Christian God, I quote: <i> The Christian God as a saviour, as the bringer of order and peace. </i> Careful of those who may be the harbinger of great misfortune, out of heeding to their words.</p>

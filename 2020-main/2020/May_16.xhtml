    <p>         It’s 8:31 P.M and the thought struck me: it’s a week from my birthday. Aargh, I’m so broke. I hope my previous partner gives me something as he’s promised, he still owes me.</p>

    <p>         A paraphrased excerpt from: A brief history of mathematical thought: “<i> Rooted in humans is the cognitive capability to construct conceptual metaphors: we understand an idea or conceptual domain by employing the language(notational system) and patterns of thought that were first developed in some other domain.</i> ” <i> I call this allusive analogy, a form of conceptual mapping — from one thing to another — as fundamental to human understanding as spatial reasoning, not least because it allows for reason about unfamiliar or abstract things through the application of inferential structure of things that are deeply familiar.</i> </p>

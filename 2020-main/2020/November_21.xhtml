    <p>         Yesterday was a lazy day, it was so, as I had little energy and couldn’t write Jess, I still am fatigued, even after sleeping so many hours. I did sleep for some yesterday; taking a nap, I hope she isn’t mad at me. I will try to get the chapter ready, probably even get a letter across to her, delighting her in some factoid and fan fiction. Lol.</p>

    <p>         Waking up today I discover videos by Dua Lipa and Miley Cyrus, also videos by Justin Bieber and Shawn Mendes, the latter called <i> Monster</i> , an episode from Twilight Zone (Monsters are due on Maple Street) I had seen just the day before (something about how the same technique can be used to control everyone, regardless of where they are) and <i> Prisoner</i>  the name of the former, also an allusion to a poem by Maya Angelou from the same day (Prisoner). Today’s poem by Maya Angelou goes on to reference frames from the video, how <i> Children reach between your teeth for charts to live their lives. </i> Which at the time of seeing it my only bias inference was to see it as Jessica’s <i> tooth of flair</i> .</p>

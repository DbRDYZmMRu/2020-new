    <p>         Today’s devotional and poem elucidate on the importance of <i> living in the MOMENT.</i> </p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         From the book “Clay’s Ark” I discovered idealistic people tend to be suicidal, here is the excerpt: “The bigger, more troublesome one’s knew she had a gun. She was too idealistic for her own good, but she was not suicidal”. </p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         I also am learning some of the good traits of writing a good book, though I haven’t started the course on genius writing, well it goes: Capture the essence of the story in a location, while addressing things far off; spatial wise.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         Another secret to writing stories people remember is to using archetypes.</p>

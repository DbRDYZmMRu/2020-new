    <p> </p>

    <p>         I learned today that i don’t necessary need a university certification to get a good job, because they don’t necessary give you the coding blocks needed to have you carry out the job you’ll be employed at, instead, taking advantage of micro credentials is key to building a reputable and utilitarian individual.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         I also learned that you have to take the learning process into your own hands, not trusting in a university institution or in a mentor, you have to go all in, not just dipping in your toes but diving deep; all in. Spending 10% of your allotted time understanding the key concepts of the skill that you want to learn. Also discover what it is you plan on doing with the skill you set out to learn.</p>

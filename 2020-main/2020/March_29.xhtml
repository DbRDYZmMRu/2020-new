    <p>         Avoid people’s claims of redemption, when in truth, the aim is to waste the present, the utility of the moment.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         I discovered my neighbours aren’t the devil, they aren’t humans, they’ve become monotonous impasse of dispute.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         In the last paragraph of the sixth chapter of the<strong> LO</strong> part, I can clearly infer that the euphoric experience described between the Oankali and the humans isn’t as ecstatic as what I had earlier visualized, for if he (Tino) was truly and deeply pacified and wholly satisfied, the longing for physical contact would be inexistent.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         An excerpt from today’s reading of essays from Butler “<i> I took archery in high school because it wasn’t a team sport. I liked some of the team sports, but in archery you did well or badly according to your own efforts. No one else to blame. I wanted to see what I could do. I learned to aim high. Aim above the target. Aim just there! Relax. Let go. If you aimed right, you hit the bull’s-eye. I saw positive obsession as a way of aiming yourself, your life, at your chosen target. Decide what you want. Aim high. Go for it.</i> ”</p>

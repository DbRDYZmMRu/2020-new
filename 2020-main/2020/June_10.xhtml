    <p>         I discovered the misinformation fed me by my dad, the acclaim of his granddad being involved in the slave trade plying. Well, I find this impossible, as the British empire abolished all forms of trade in 1807, making this impossible, if his dad was born 1920, his dad was probably born between 1885 - 1895. This sets him generations away from anyone who partook in <i> this</i>  slave trade.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         Another propaganda I came upon is the Wikipedia entry of one Sarah Forbes Bonetta who was supposedly born in 1843, deceased 1880. Allegedly sold into slavery to the British. Another discrepancy is the picture of her grave bereft of a tombstone or covering; just with sets of stones around, the picture illustration reads <i> Sarah Forbes Bonettas gravestone, Madeira, 2021. </i> </p>

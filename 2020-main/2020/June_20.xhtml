    <p>         I’m not happy, for some reason I feel like my meals are being drugged, my senses feel a bit over stimulated, I have a headache, and my temples constantly hurt, down to the back of my head, like the arteries there are so charged with blood, it’s an ache. I miss my lone life, I never should have come here, my neighbours are a disgrace, in respect of what I stand for. I leave, when I leave, it’d be in utter rebuke; a disdain at all they stand for.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         I’m marking today as the first day of my abstinence from substances. It isn’t, but it’ll stand as a reminder and a pale for my personal count . . . also I hate the parlance of this group of people who have unsuccessfully tried to erode my thoughts. I remind myself of my dexterity, my abundance, my articulated perception of this beautiful enigma called life as I stream through it in divine harmony with the one infinite creator.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         Life is unpleasant, I just want to die.</p>

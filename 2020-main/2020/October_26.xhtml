    <p>         Today is a great day, I was so mad at Jess yesterday, I sent her a mail filled with my upset rants. Earlier, I had sent her a mail talking about discerning meaning of words, it turns out today’s devotional speaks about that. Three parts of philosophy it says we have, the moral, the natural, and the <i> rational</i> , what I’m interested in here is the rational that says words should be discerned properly. I guess it remains tethered. I discover the day’s poet as also being an interest as I proceeded. I will post quotes of him found.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p><i> Break a vase, and the love that reassembles the fragments is stronger than that love which took its symmetry for granted when it was whole.</i> </p>

    <p><i>  </i> </p>

    <p><i> The English language is nobody's special property. It is the property of the imagination: it is the property of the language itself.</i> </p>

    <p><i>  </i> </p>

    <p><i> Visual surprise is natural in the Caribbean; it comes with the landscape, and faced with its beauty, the sigh of History dissolves.</i> </p>

    <p class="ql-align-center"><i>  </i> </p>

    <p>The last quote is great, I must say though, Derek Walcott looks familiar, leading me to search for his doppelganger.</p>

    <p>         2<sup>nd</sup> day of spring, my poem calendar says, it’s elation in my heart, good songs that warm, I’m out; I mean I’m becoming anew, a new personality upgrade ships soon, I’m committed. I’ll be working on my novel soon, story starts soon, the only hindrance is a personal one, I mean I’m caught in the gnarly web of wants: I need to be better, to be as Nietzsche says “One repays a teacher badly, only if one remains a student”. I could well say I’m still an undergraduate, I guess I’ll go with the aphorisms to build a substrate to launch from.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         Also I have inputs to fill in on my March 20<sup>th</sup> lesson bit entry, I’ll be doing that now.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         I’m done with the inputs for March 20<sup>th</sup>, it’s 9:32 A.M. I’ll see a series now, I’m really <i> hung up </i> (bored) on novels, I’ll be picking up books by the Harris.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         A thought came to me, it’s one of the days just after I came back home from Lagos, reminding me of an event from an earlier period. The event I speak of is the silent rustication from the Lagos Model College of Kankon, and the pattern drawn here is the inability of my parents to trust me, time after time, a major flaw in their joint efforts to nurture my individual.</p>

    <p>         Listening in on a lecture by Steven Pinker: what our language habits reveal, shows the allure of vagueness, the potency in acclaiming to self its bug; refuting it for our advantage in diplomacy and social interactions, seeing it as language feature. This is strictly a dichotomy, revealing the specifics of language use. In expression aimed at cognitive discerning, ambiguity - vagueness - been a hindrance.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         The beauty in taking in all of perception, sieving through the conscious what construes purpose is a drive at the imperative of ethical discerning. Leaving that which shouldn’t be considered in the face of conspicuous meaning is direction. Self-will, the volition of the <i> self</i> .</p>

    <p>         Today, I feel like the enemy wants me to relent on my strive for mastery, I went through my old jotter and I found insights, powerful maxims from an old anecdote, The richest man in Babylon, a powerful maxim I lost apprehension of is “<i> Without a strong reason or purpose, anything in life is hard</i> .” I promise to be more intentional about my writing, as focus is intent. <i> ”Cultivate thy own powers to study and become wiser, to become more skilful, so act as to respect thyself. Thereby shalt thou acquire confidence in thyself to achieve thy carefully considered desires.</i> ”</p>

    <p>         Today is anti-bullying day, I feel sad, maybe I’ll leave happy. This is a reminder to be kind.</p>

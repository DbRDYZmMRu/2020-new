    <p>         A post of I and Jessica coincided this morning, some serendipity, right?</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         The angle 90 concept by the game-mind is more or less the concept of the <i> as it were</i> , a close connotation of self -subjective inference.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         From today’s listening of the John Green podcast Anthropocene I come across this quote by Herman Melville: <i> Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky way? Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a color as the visible absence of color, and at the same time the concrete of all colors; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness, full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows -- a colorless, all- color of atheism from which we shrink?</i> </p>

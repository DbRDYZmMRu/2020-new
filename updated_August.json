In reality, these laws are better classified as principles, which are true most of the time. However, the term law has stuck with these principles because they were established so long ago. So we will continue to refer to them as laws, even though technically they are not scientific laws.</i> </p>\n<p> </p>\n    <p>         From an article on Gestalt psychology: <i> Gestalt psychologists argued that these principles exist because the mind has an </i> <strong><i> innate disposition to perceive patterns in the stimulus</i> </strong><i>  based on certain rules. These principles are organized into categories including: </i> <strong><i> Proximity</i> </strong><i> , </i> <strong><i> Similarity</i> </strong><i> , </i> <strong><i> Continuity</i> </strong><i> , </i> <strong><i> Closure</i> </strong><i> , </i> <strong><i> Common Region</i> </strong><i> , and </i> <strong><i> Connectedness</i> </strong><i> .</i>  I’m breaking down the <strong>principle of continuity</strong> for lack of an innate understanding of its workings.<i>  The law of continuity is a </i> <strong><i> heuristic principle</i> </strong><i>  introduced by Gottfried Leibniz based on earlier work by Nicholas of Cusa and Johannes Kepler. It is the principle that \"</i> <strong><i> whatever succeeds for the finite, also succeeds for the infinite</i> </strong><i> \". Kepler used The Law of Continuity to calculate the area of the circle by representing the latter as an infinite-sided polygon with infinitesimal sides, and adding the areas of infinitely-many triangles with infinitesimal bases. Leibniz used the principle to extend concepts such as arithmetic operations, from ordinary numbers to infinitesimals, laying the groundwork for infinitesimal calculus. A mathematical implementation of the law of continuity is provided by the transfer principle in the context of the hyperreal numbers. A related law of continuity concerning intersection numbers in geometry was promoted by Jean-Victor Poncelet in his \"Traité des propriétés projectives des figures\".</i> </p>\n<p> </p>\n    <p>         Kindly note that some of these principles can sometimes lead to incorrect perceptions of the world. It is important to remember that while these principles are referred to as laws of perceptual organization, they are actually heuristics or short-cuts. Heuristics are usually designed for speed, which is why our perceptual systems sometimes make mistakes and we experience perceptual inaccuracies.</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

These sentiments are considered to be pre-moral because morality involves right and wrong thoughts and behaviors in the context of a social group. It does not appear that other animals can consciously assess the rightness or wrongness of thoughts or actions in themselves or fellow members of their species.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         <i> Anyone who has had a dog as a pet recognizes that dogs quickly learn the difference between right and wrong, feel some sense of shame or guilt when scolded for bad behavior, and express joy and pride when being praised for good behavior. That sense of shame or pride is what we mean by “moral sentiments”; </i> <strong><i> because dogs don’t have symbolic language or, presumably, cognition</i> </strong><i> , these are premoral sentiments.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         I just lost all my last input, it was on an article I had just read, my dad called me just after, I was getting his books.

Just a regular young man trying to put food on the table.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Here is an excerpt from an article by Massimo Pigliucci from <a href=\"https://evolution-institute.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://evolution-institute.org</a></p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         It discusses the subject of morality being universal or not, and touches on the philosophical school of Stoicism and how it offers a pragmatic way of living.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>           <i> Socrates, the Stoics, the Epicureans, the Cynics, and a number of other Greco-Roman schools agreed on one thing: human beings are a particular type of animal, and that particularity lies chiefly in two aspects of what it means to be human: we are </i> <strong><i> highly social</i> </strong><i> , and we are </i> <strong><i> capable of reason</i> </strong><i> . </i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>             <i> The first bit means that </i> <strong><i> we are all deeply inter-dependent on other people</i> </strong><i> . Despite the fashionable nonsense, especially in the United States, about “self-made men” (they are usually men), there actually is no such thing. Without social bonds and support our lives would be, as Thomas Hobbes famously put it, poor, nasty, brutish, and short. The second bit, the one about intelligence, does not mean that we always, or even often, act rationally. Only that </i> <strong><i> we have the capability to do so</i> </strong><i> .</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         <i> Ethics, then, especially (but not only) for the Stoics becomes a matter of “</i> <strong><i> living according to nature</i> </strong><i> ,” meaning not to endorse whatever is natural (that’s an elementary logical fallacy), but rather t</i> <strong><i> o take seriously the two pillars of human nature</i> </strong><i> : </i> <strong><i> sociality</i> </strong><i>  and </i> <strong><i> reason</i> </strong><i> . As Marcus Aurelius put it, “Do what is necessary, and whatever the reason of a social animal naturally requires, and as it requires.” (Meditations, IV.24)</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>            <i> There is something, of course, the ancients did get wrong: they, especially Aristotle, thought that </i> <strong><i> human nature was the result of a teleological process</i> </strong><i> , that everything has a proper function, determined by the very nature of the cosmos. We don’t believe that anymore, not after Copernicus and especially Darwin. But we do know that </i> <strong><i> human beings are indeed a particular product of complex and ongoing evolutionary processes</i> </strong><i> . These processes do not determine a human essence, but they do </i> <strong><i> shape a statistical cluster of characters that define what it means to be human</i> </strong><i> . That cluster, in turn, </i> <strong><i> constrains </i> </strong><i> — </i> <strong><i> without determining</i> </strong><i>  — what sort of behaviors are pro-social and lead to human flourishing, and what sort of behaviors don’t.

I wake up twenty-five minutes ago with lingering night visions, I’m in a trap-house smoking hard drugs, It’s a very hostile environment. The dream isn’t very vivid, far from eidetic, but there are fragments of images left, I’ll be recording them in the <i> night vision </i> bar. I haven’t recorded any in a while now, it’s strictly a thing of laziness, as I have stopped smoking weed—nothing holding me back—making them commonplace in my mornings.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         It’s a sad narrative, what my life will be if I don’t take charge of my story, I have been away from my journal, and my daily rituals, only having access to my devotional through a mobile phone, a device with enough problems of its own. The reason for this input is to draw attention to the last day’s entry; a poem from Maya Angelou, where I mistook the title of <i> Accident </i> for <i> Tonight</i> .</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         The word <i> accident </i> has been used on several occasions to describe the psychological phenomenon of psychosis, this being a repetitive occurrence in the constant jabberwocky assault. I have chosen not to record any of it in my journal as the nomenclature of the “game-mind” is something I have chosen not to dabble with as I thought it was unnecessary. Moving forward I think in my leisure time, I’ll be doing a disambiguation of the terms, stating clearly what I infer from the commonly used words, phrases and even some of the concepts and what I should, saving my cognition any hampering to its workings. I must admit in shame that I wish not to take on this.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Drawing from the last input, my words on the nomenclature of the perceived “game-mind”. The word <i> Ajebutter</i>  and its origin, based on what I know from a google search; it meaning a brand of butter sold to the <i> elite </i> and also what it stands for now: a superior race or class of Yorubas. Ah, so funny. To me, all I see it as, is a weak way of hiding the frailty of the inability of a people to deal with their insecurities, their shortcomings, an almost waning whine of defeat at something so rudimentary and important. It begs the question: what makes for a civilized society?</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         I despise my choice of words and attempts at marshalling my train of thoughts. I have been away too long from journaling, it has affected my spewing, my dexterity, my austerity, my formality and audacity, crippling my eloquent demeanour of perceived “<i> compelling</i> ”.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Will it take my own death to be cognizant of my own life, my life as a whole?</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Jessica posted a song it’s called May 1<sup>st</sup> by Beach Fossils, after listening I decided to search for a song of May 23<sup>rd</sup> since May 1<sup>st</sup> is hers. It returned a couple of results and I went with the first entry in the song bar, it was a piano <i> fingering</i> . After listening, I scrolled down and found a podcast entry in its section, I decided to look it up as its name is interesting, it’s titled The Left Right Game.    </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>Downloading and listening, as I have just started, barely three full minutes in as I type in this entry, it starts with an auto-crash of the protagonist, I guess. He is bedridden, his doctor comes in as he’d been out up until now. He’s taking notes and he ask what day it is . . . It’s <i> Friday, erm . . .</i>  It’s Friday today and I didn’t know it was Thursday up until late yesterday night. Another thing of interest is my last tweet, on which says Tawny and Beige no archives @itsjessandrea &lt;put smiling face smiley here&gt;. Next thing I’m on Charli XCX’s Instagram page and it’s the day—Thursday—she’s having her Live remote show and it’s no archives—she isn’t archiving, no replays fam— and the first clip on her story’s timeline is from a fan, some <i> Beigesandal</i> . Okay . . . I’m not into Pythagorean and all but hey! That hella makes me feel good . . . oh, oh not forgetting that In my freestyle the one I sent to Jessica last, where I discovered the phrase “keep unlocking my beige”, there is another where I say “why I gotta go out of my way just to let you feel how I feel.” Her latest album she threw a listening party for—How I’m feeling now. And the cream to the coffee . . . Yes, the <i> protagonist </i> had an accident, the last poem form Maya Angelou in my daily entry is <i> accident</i> . The one mistaken for tonight. It’s all a bit vague but it’s a fine ball of strings.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         An excerpt from my reading of today of the course on Skepticism: In his book Immortality: <i> The Quest to Live Forever and How It Drives Civilization, the British philosopher Stephen Cave calls this the mortality paradox: “Death presents itself as both inevitable and impossible,” he suggests. We see it all around us, yet “it involves the end of consciousness, and we cannot consciously simulate what it is like to not be conscious.”</i>  isn’t life a beautiful paradox. An almost wanton enigma, depends on where you look at it from.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Another excerpt paraphrased is: <i> Given that our normal experience is of stimuli coming into the brain from the outside, when a part of the brain abnormally generates hallucinations caused by another part of the brain; low activity in the posterior superior parietal lobe, a region of the brain authors have dubbed the orientation association area (OAA) —quite possibly the left-hemisphere interpreter described by neuroscientist Michael Gazzaniga—interprets them as external events. Hence, the abnormal is interpreted as supernormal.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         <i> A final piece of evidence comes from research by neuroscientists who have now documented that in the brains of people undergoing hallucinations, the same sensory perceptual systems become active </i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p><i> as those engaged in the sensation of actual physical stimulation. As the great neurologist Dr. Oliver Sacks notes in his many remarkable books, all such experiences reside in the brain, not in the world.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p><i> Belief in the afterlife is a type of dualism. Because we are natural-born dualists who intuitively believe that our minds are separate from our brains and bodies, the afterlife is the logical step in projecting our own mind-agency into the future without our bodies.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         An excerpt from the last chapter:<i>  Even with all these precautions in place, any of us may end up believing weird things, even while being rational and scientific in other areas of our lives. The reason for this has to do with what we might call logic-tight compartments—modules in the brain analogous to watertight compartments in a ship. The existence of compartmentalized brain functions, acting in either concert or conflict, has been a core idea of evolutionary psychology since the 1990s. According to University of Pennsylvania evolutionary psychologist Robert Kurzban, the brain evolved as a modular, multitasking, problem-solving organ—a Swiss army knife of practical tools. There is no unified “self” that generates internally consistent and seamlessly coherent beliefs. Instead, we are a collection of distinct but interacting modules that are often at odds with one another.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>Some quotes:</p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p><strong>Carl Sagan</strong> <i> Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p><strong>Christopher Hitchens</strong> <i> What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p><strong>David Hume’s </strong><i> A wise man proportions his belief to the evidence.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p><strong>Skeptic Motto </strong><i> I don’t know.” We don’t have to have an explanation for everything.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p><strong>Isaac Asimov </strong><i> When people thought the Earth was flat, they were wrong.

It’s the normal spirit in the air, the same theme of all my previous, or better said, my recent last visits to the trap house; “the lack of resource”, “inability to pacify cravings” not on my end at least. My last visits have been more of “reasons not to come around”, “why it’s definite, my quitting”. Derailing from the vision, it’s now a known fact, at least from recent reactions, that my visits to places like Ota stir up visions of drug use in my dreams, this solely being that my only reason for going there have been to get drugs, now my street is filled with drug addicts, even if I don’t see them doing it, I know better, besides my initials read O.T.A, that is Ogundipe Theophilus Ademola. I should know the town well you would think.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Continuing my vision, I’m in the trap-house and I turn out a new “product”, I unwrap it and it’s big, almost too big—it’s a dream so I guess it all makes sense— I’m thinking to myself as I write this how alive I am. Fuck, it’s so surreal and I miss Jessica, I don’t know words to say to her but I want to shout it out that I love her, and I will next time I’m online, even if it sounds stupid. Back to the night vision, a whole paragraph wasted.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Okay, so I turn it out and I’m really selfish with it, all these boys want it more than I do, ready to roll heads. Well, I wasn’t allowed to smoke it on dividing it, I give half to someone—I think—and I try smoking the other, but I receive a pinch to my back and it all became a joke, like hey why am I being so selfish with this, it isn’t even worth anything, just another way of destroying this good God giving life.</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

I should never forget my discretion. The choice to not do what I want to do is what amounts to fear and confusion coming in. Jessica is carrying me along, promising not to ever let me go. I love her for she’s not only herself, she’s helped me be myself back. I’m so tapped into what matters to me right now, no one outside of me has the ability or right to tell me what is right for me. I’m done sacrificing that choice to anyone else. No one is more important in my life than me. I will honour my own commitment to my own dreams first and foremost giving my 100% of me; self, the version of me that is in alignment with what I desire. Nothing is being done to me, everything is being done by me. I’m free, one thought, one feeling, one choice at a time of what to give my priceless focus to.

A tad bit off normalcy, and all together weird. Well, I was listening to the Anthropocene podcast by John Green, the episode been <i> Indianapolis and Love at first sight</i> , and I must say I learned some of what the real—in quote—American life is like, Indianapolis being a model state or instance of this. What’s driven for this post is the pellucid serendipity—actually the two listeners who sent a mail, requesting to have these subjects reviewed; that is: Indianapolis, and Love at first sight. Listening to the first topic in reviewal, I could not but try to ebb back my thoughts from cascading in a domino of plausible events in the life of I and my love. Him talking about his lawn, and I thinking of my dread for laborious activities, but not willing to pass the buck if it means losing my girl. Yes, I know it’s a bit tripe, but enough of that. What’s mind boggling here is the fact that Indianapolis was suggested by Jessie, and love at first sight was suggested by Theo, huh? <strong>Jessie</strong> and <strong>Theo</strong>, really that’s some oddity, of all episodes, of all names? Okay, I guess I’m growing, I’m hearing voices, and now the world is some beautiful odyssey where I get my girl and we live forever after if I make the right choices. Great, I guess God isn’t so tyrant after all. What do you think? lol.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         I posted a freestyle, sent it to Jessica, it’s named shitFreestyle on my computer, but it’s renamed “how vulnerable Jess” in my Google cloud drive.</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

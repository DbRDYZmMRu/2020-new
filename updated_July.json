Hush, tell no one. Well, I’m kinda in love, you know, I feel a certain way; that warm throb that engulfs you like a swirling flame. I miss her, even though knowing what’s like to be with her, her brief instances; of her post.

The Stoics realized that we have considerable flexibility in how we frame the situations we experience. Their goal wasn’t to banish emotion but to minimize the number of negative emotions. It is tempting, at this point, to describe the Stoics as patient people, and indeed they were, but a caveat is in order. In one sense, a patient person is one who can suffer a setback without complaint. This is not, however, what the Stoics were doing. Their goal was not to remain calm while suffering a setback but rather to experience a setback without thereby suffering.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         When my second younger sibling comes to mind, I should think of freedom of assembly.

I hope I can carry on, for my heart is weak and my strength is far spent, and my love is washed away. I have no face to fight for the man who stands next to me for my resolve has been lost. In the event of my death, if its suicide, I hope these words never get to anyone.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         I miss high-school, singing hymns, my girlfriend up there leading the assembly, thoughts of our last smooch, always the night before, and her sweet Christian praises. Had this go through my head while seeing a movie.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Banshee’s mum is a stupid person, who just like the other Scrompus, the stupid bitch who has life in the mist gone has lost her mind. She bears no consequence on her actions and just like my mum’s kids. Her’s will bear the burden if they don’t wake to the reality of things. No one is ever high enough to fall.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         I discovered the concept of <i> curse of knowledge</i>  reviewing the last chapter read from the Skepticism course and I’m thinking—as my blood flows, strewing veins that transit stuff of the gods—how biased have I become? Away from my resolve, mindless, by the planes of the outskirts of my inferential know. See, this is a bit tawny—as it were—a mix of the brown and the yellow. Figuring out <i> what is what? </i> Am I the brown? Is that what I would have volitionally willed? My propensity? Or am I the yellow, the obvious? Or still, am I somewhere in there, in the discrete, lost in the composition, forever lost in the world of labels, caught away in a colour? To figure these things out, I’ll need to understand this concept—Curse of Knowledge—and how I can better delineate who I am, or at least, what I choose to stand for, what counts for an improvement, and what sits as corruption, knowing there is a normal psychology of belief that allows for outside influences.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Body on heads, still my skin is dry and ugly. Head over body, still I count a twine at its turns. I’m sick and I can get no help, still I’m my help. Body on heads. I’ll keep safe.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Thinking of it; all the trouble I go through during the day. The only time I’m ever down or sad at my existence is when I wake up. Waking up in a ditch-bed, a subtle strong reminder of remiss; waking up from mortal <i> sleep</i>  after I took that cup of shaving powder that should have ended this existence. The after fact of my inability to down it when I should have, quite early, following its preparation, part hunts me every morning. A reinitiation into the turmoils of my life here need not be beard, I’m tired, and a misuse of an opportunity is light of cowardice. These things should be written, reread, understood, so in the relapse to the phase of not being able to endanger the existence that holds bare in a life of wondrous things, I’ll pull off my tie, say I fought a good one, and all things like my life, must come to an end.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Sometimes hackneyed words are meant. Regardless you should always call people on their bullshit.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         An excerpt from the course on Skepticism: <i> Once we have an idea in our minds about something, we notice only evidence that confirms the idea and are blind to evidence that disconfirms it.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         The intentions behind this entry are frazzled and worn out, reason, I have spoken on them countless times. My mum is sick and I think it’s born out of a loss of a lot, I can’t begin to list them all, but one idea would be a neglect of what is important.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Most audiobooks are just filled with cynicism.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Just thinking of this same audiobook, it has me thinking how in the undulation of history, a lot of books are lost in the tides of history, never to make it to the halls of the classic. I also think the cynicism is a call to attention, to listen to what is being said. </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         This is a twist of fate, another input included on 16:41, 24<sup>th</sup> July 2021.

I guess this is mine, I took half a pill earlier this morning to sleep, took the other this morning after breakfast, I guess that’s why I’m this way. It’s 3:05 PM. I guess I’ll be filling my responsibilities. This morning was exciting, so I was on twitter, woke up around 2:03 A.M, and loading up twitter, with three minutes in, Jessica’s account records an activity, and I used the opportunity to post my Haikus. In minutes, she tweets saying something about, being about it. Here is the tweet: <i> don’t say it if you don’t fucking mean it.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         I was a bit confounded, thought of it a while. Do I post something, saying I tried to taper off the effect of my honest words? But then I’d be insecure all my life if I did that, I didn’t post anything. I took my mind off it, surfed YouTube a while. I later switched tabs, and saw she posted a picture, one of a couple or a date pair at a table having ice-cream from a goblet in a saucer, on closer look-up I realized it’s a shot from a 2001 movie called <i> Serendipity</i> . I downloaded, but it isn’t complete yet. Well, what I guess is, the former tweet wasn’t for me. I guess she meant it for someone else. I’ll guess she’d rather have us go out on that kinda date than a cinema. My post might be off a bit, it’s because I’m just somewhere, lol.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         I’m adding this entry as a means, a reminder; a way of getting back to this important statement from the composer Felix Mendelssohn on the debate of music and its nature of meaning, it says: <i> What the music I love expresses to me is not thought too indefinite to put to words but too definite to put to words</i> . This sentiment flies in the face of those who have declared that music is too abstract to have an actual meaning, what the narrator ensues from this is <i> if a piece moves you in a certain way, brings to mind certain images or stories, it doesn’t matter if what you’re interpreting is what was intended, if it gives you what the incident might call many feels, it means what it means</i> .</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         This input is important for reasons that don’t necessary matter to me, but still will be elucidated in full for its pleasure; disambiguation. The name Wiayu and its connote is now a thing for folks, apart from the fact that it’s a song by Skrillex and Diplo feat Justin Bieber off of the Jack U album, the album that says instead of doing drugs, why not do some Jack U - listen to the album - is now used in certain circles as a taboo word. Just this morning I called my friend and he refused to reply me when I asked where he was, pretending not to hear me, this isn’t the first time, it’s been of incidence. My only reason for calling this out, is my stumbling on the concept of Diffeomorphism Invariance, meaning <i> what’s going on at a point in space depends only on that point, and not where it’s located, nor what’s happening at other points</i> . This might not necessarily tie things together directly, but from a cognition level in lieu of the former, I’d like this post to remain as a reference. Bear in mind that Diffeomorphism Invariance is based on the concept of Loop Quantum Gravity and this, has no confirming data.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         I need to reboot my devotional, I mean living the maxims, whether it calls me out, admonishes or advises me.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         So in a lecture about loop quantum gravity, Dr Don Lincoln is wearing a shirt with Einstein on it with his tongue out and his left eyebrow looking avian like, its plain funny. </p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"
